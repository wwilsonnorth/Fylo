### Fylo - https://wwilsonnorth.github.io/Fylo

A challenge from Frontend Mentor called <b>Fylo dark theme landing page</b> where you are provided with the design and starter code then required to build out the landing page from the resources given. I made use of CSS variables throughout and a mixture of CSS Grids and Flexbox. I used Figma to work out the appropriate dimensions for all elements on the page.
