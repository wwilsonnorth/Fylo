# Fylo

This was a challenge from Frontend Mentor called <b>Fylo dark theme landing page</b> where you download the design and starter code then build out the landing page from the resources given. I made use of CSS variables to make my code cleaner, using a mixture of CSS Grids and Flexbox. I used Figma to work out the appropriate sizings for elements on the page.
